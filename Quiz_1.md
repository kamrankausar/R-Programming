Question 1

The R language is a dialect of which of the following programming languages?

Answer

S

Explanation

R is a dialect of the S language which was developed at Bell Labs.

Question 2

The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition?

Answer

The freedom to sell the software for any price.

Explanation

This is not part of the free software definition. The free software definition does not mention anything about selling software (although it does not disallow it).

Question 3

In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT

Answer

matrix

Explanation

'matrix' is not an atomic data type in R.

Question 4

If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object 'x' as determined by the 'class()' function?

Answer

numeric

Explanation

> x <- 4
> class(x)
[1] "numeric"
Question 5

What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?

Answer

numeric

Explanation

The numeric class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.

R does automatic coercion of vectors so that all elements of the vector are the same data class.

> x <- c(4, TRUE)
> class(x)
[1] "numeric"
Question 6

If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?

Answer

a 2 by 3 numeric matrix

Explanation

The 'rbind' function treats vectors as if they were rows of a matrix. It then takes those vectors and binds them together row-wise to create a matrix.

> x <- c(1, 3, 5)
> y <- c(3, 2, 10)
> rbind(x, y)
    [,1] [,2] [,3]
  x    1    3    5
  y    3    2   10
Question 7

A key property of vectors in R is that

Answer

elements of a vector all must be of the same class

Question 8

Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me?

Answer

a character vector of length 1.

Explanation

> x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE)
> x[[2]]
  [1] "a"
Question 9

Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2:3. What is produced by the expression x + y?

Answer

an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.

Explanation

> x <- 1:4
> y <- 2:3
> x + y
[1] 3 5 5 7
Question 10

Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. What R code achieves this?

Answer

x[x < 6] <- 0

Explanation

You can create a logical vector with the expression x < 6 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.

> x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6)
> x[x < 6] <- 0
> x
[1]  0  0  0 10 12  6
Question 11

In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

Answer

Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day

Explanation

You can get the column names of a data frame with the 'names()' function.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> names(hw1)
[1] "Ozone"   "Solar.R" "Wind"    "Temp"    "Month"   "Day"
Question 12

Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

Answer

  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
Explantion

You can extract the first two rows using the [ operator and an integer sequence to index the rows.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> hw1[c(1,2),]
  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
Question 13

How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

Answer

153

Explanation

You can use the 'nrows()' function to compute the number of rows in a data frame.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> nrow(hw1)
[1] 153
Question 14

Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

Answer

   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30
Explanation

The 'tail()' function is an easy way to extract the last few elements of an R object.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> tail(hw1,2)
    Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30
Question 15

What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

Answer

21

Explanation

The single bracket [ operator can be used to extract individual rows of a data frame.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> hw1[15,]
   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
15    18      65 13.2   58     5  15
Question 16

How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?

Answer

37

Explanation

The 'is.na' function can be used to test for missing values.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, is.na(Ozone))
> nrow(sub)
[1] 37
Question 17

What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

Answer

42.1

Explanation

The 'mean' function can be used to calculate the mean.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, !is.na(Ozone), select = Ozone)
> apply(sub, 2, mean)
   Ozone 
42.12931 
Question 18

Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

Answer

212.8

Explanation

You need to construct a logical vector in R to match the question's requirements. Then use that logical vector to subset the data frame.

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, Ozone > 31 & Temp > 90, select = Solar.R)
> apply(sub, 2, mean)
Solar.R 
  212.8 
Question 19

What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?

Answer

79.1

Explanation

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, Month == 6, select = Temp)
> apply(sub, 2, mean)
Temp 
79.1
Question 20

What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?

Answer

115

Explantion

> hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
> sub = subset(hw1, Month == 5 & !is.na(Ozone), select = Ozone)
> apply(sub, 2, max)
Ozone 
  115
